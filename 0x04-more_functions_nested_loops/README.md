Functions -> Are self-contained blocks of code that perfoms a specific task. They allow you to reuse code.
Functions are declared using the 'function prototype' syntax: which specifies the function name, return type and parameter list
	int add(int a, int b);

Nested loops -> are loops inside another loop. They are usually iterated over multitude dimensions of data (eg: rows and columns)
	for (int i = 1; i<= 10; i++) {}
