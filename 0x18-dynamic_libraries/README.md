### Dynamic Libraries

- A dynamic library, also called a shared library or DLL (Dynamic Link Library) in Windows systems, is a compiled binary file containing code and data that can be used by multiple programs simultaneously.

- They are not linked directly into the executable during compile time. Instead, they are linked at runtime when the program is loaded into memory

 * Dynamic linking is the process of linking a program with a dynamic library at runtime when the program is loaded into memory


### Static Library

- A static library, also known as an archive, is a collection of compiled object code that is linked directly into an executable binary at compile time

- It contains pre-compiled functions and code that can be reused by multiple programs.

* Static linking is the process of including the entire code of a library into the final executable at compile time. The resulting executable becomes self-contained and does not depend on any external libraries
